<p>Executing SQL queries is security-sensitive. It has led in the past to the following vulnerabilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-9019">CVE-2018-9019</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-7318">CVE-2018-7318</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5611">CVE-2017-5611</a> </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection">SQL injection</a> is still one of the top 10 security vulnerabilities. Applications that
execute SQL commands should sanitize any externally-provided values used in those commands. Failure to do so could allow an attacker to include input
that changes the query so that unintended commands are executed, or sensitive data is exposed. Instead of trying to sanitize data by hand, SQL binding
mechanisms should be used; they can be relied on to automatically perform a full sanitization.</p>
<p>This rule flags the execution of SQL queries via Django methods which are not recommended by Django documentation as their use can result in an SQL
injection. The goal is to guide security code reviews.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Avoid building queries manually using concatenation or formatting. If you do it anyway, do not include user input in this building process.
  </li>
  <li> Use <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet">parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored
  procedures</a> whenever possible. </li>
  <li> Avoid executing SQL queries containing unsafe input in stored procedures or functions. </li>
  <li> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet">Sanitize</a> every unsafe input. </li>
  <li> Follow <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/security/#sql-injection-protection">Django best practices</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>You can also reduce the impact of an attack by using a database account with low privileges.</p>
<h2>Questionable Code Example</h2>
<pre>
from django.db import models
from django.db import connection
from django.db import connections
from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL

value = input()


class MyUser(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)


def query_my_user(request, params):
    MyUser.objects.raw(request)  # Questionable

    # Parametrized queries
    MyUser.objects.raw(request, params)  # Questionable.

    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(request)  # Questionable

    with connections['my_db'].cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute(request)  # Questionable

    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/expressions/#raw-sql-expressions

    RawSQL("select col from mytable where mycol = %s", ("test",))  # Questionable, See "Note"

    # https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/querysets/#extra

    MyUser.objects.extra(  # Questionable. calling the "extra" method, See "Note"
        select={
            'mycol': 'myothercol &gt; 10'
        },
    )
</pre>
